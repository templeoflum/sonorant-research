## Summary

Complete aesthetic identity overhaul. Removed mythic framing, restructured sonic priorities as co-equal constraints, added "System as Evolving Instrument" framework.

## Changes Made

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `VISION.md` | Section 2 rewritten (co-equal constraints); Section 4 rewritten (sonic liberation / transduction instrumentation); Section 4.5 added (System as Evolving Instrument); removed [NEEDS CONFIRMATION] tag; removed "Ritual-grade" from use case |
| `AGENT_PLAN.md` | Updated Distilled Vision, Aesthetic & Identity, and Technical Design Priorities sections |
| `README.md` | Project description updated; Directive 007 added to status table |
| `PLANNING_LOG.md` | Verified — already replaced with domain-based structure |
| `DEVLOG.md` | Entry 9 added |
| `handoff/007_response.md` | Created (this file) |

## New Framework Summary

**Ethos:** Sonic liberation — sound as force, presence, and freedom

**Visual Language:** Transduction instrumentation — physics-driven form, material honesty, exposed function as the only ornament

**Palette:** Oscilloscope lineage (Tektronix Gray, Bakelite Black, natural wood, brushed metal, functional indicators)

**System Animacy:** Presence earned through modular evolution, operator relationship, acoustic interaction, and accumulated collective experience — not narrative or branding

## Rejected Terms (for reference)

The following terms have been explicitly removed from all active project language:
- "Mythopoetic" / "mythogenetic"
- "Sonic entity" / "transcension engine"
- "Sonic activation"
- "Myth-tech" / "audio-transmutation"
- "Ritual-grade"
- "Glitchy mythopoetic cyber surrealism"

These appear only in historical documentation explaining their removal.
