# Directive 007 — Aesthetic Identity Overhaul & Sonic Priority Restructure

**From:** Planning instance (claude.ai)  
**To:** Transducer Archive (CLI agent)  
**Date:** 2025-02-05

## Context

The project owner has reviewed VISION.md and identified two structural issues and one major content overhaul:

1. **Section 2 (Sonic Priorities)** uses a ranked list. The owner confirms all five priorities are co-equal constraints, not a hierarchy. Ranking implies tradeoffs that don't apply — the system must satisfy all five simultaneously.

2. **Section 4 (Aesthetic Identity)** still uses "glitchy mythopoetic cyber surrealism" — language inherited from early ChatGPT brainstorming sessions. The owner has explicitly and repeatedly rejected the term "mythopoetic" (carries 1980s–90s men's movement associations that do not align with the project's philosophy). The term "mythogenetic" was considered but also rejected for this context — it belongs to a separate project (MythOS) and importing it conflates two distinct creative domains. The entire mythic framing has been dropped.

3. **A new conceptual layer is needed:** The system is designed to develop presence and character over time — not as metaphor but as the natural result of modular evolution, operator relationship, acoustic interaction with spaces, and accumulated collective experience. This replaces the "sonic entity" / "transcension engine" language with a grounded framework for system animacy.

The replacement aesthetic identity was developed through a detailed analysis of the owner's 15+ year creative trajectory, including glitch art practice, sound design philosophy, video synthesis research, festival culture involvement, and DIY infrastructure building. The key insight: Sonorant's aesthetic should emerge from its own substrate (air pressure, physical material, transduction physics) rather than borrowing from the owner's digital or mythological work.

## Objective

Update all files that contain aesthetic identity language, remove the sonic priority ranking, and add the "System as Evolving Instrument" framework. No new research. No changes to company reports, knowledge base, research queue, or scoring data.

## Part A: VISION.md — Rewrite Sections 2 and 4, Add New Section

### A1: Section 2 — Remove ranking, present as co-equal constraints

**Current:** "Sonic Priorities (Ranked)" with a numbered list implying hierarchy.

**Replace with:**

```markdown
## 2. Sonic Priorities (Co-Equal Constraints)

These five priorities define the design space simultaneously. None is ranked above another — the system must satisfy all five. They are the shape of the box, not a stack inside it.

- **Psychoacoustic immersion** — spatial depth, envelopment, wide stereo imaging that creates a believable soundstage; the "audio moment"
- **Sub weight** — tactile, chest-presence bass with infrasonic extension; sub-30Hz response felt in the body, not just heard; "chest pressure, not just rumble"
- **Hyper-real clarity** — crystal clear vocals, high resolution for intricate soundscapes; preservation of microdetails even in lo-fi or bitcrushed recordings
- **Fast transients** — snap, articulation, dynamic punch; tight transient control especially in sub and mid-bass range
- **Small-room optimization** — 100–200 capacity venues; reflection control; must translate emotionally in nearfield or small space

These are derived from emphasis patterns in conversation logs and confirmed by the project owner. They are not tradeoffs — a design that sacrifices one for another has failed.
```

Remove the `[NEEDS CONFIRMATION]` tag. The owner has confirmed.

### A2: Section 4 — Complete rewrite of Aesthetic Identity

**Current:** References "glitchy mythopoetic cyber surrealism," "sonic activation," "awakening tool," and defers naming/identity decisions.

**Replace entire Section 4 with:**

```markdown
## 4. Aesthetic Identity

### Ethos: Sonic Liberation

Sound as force, presence, and freedom. The system is the medium through which perceptual constraint is recognized and dissolved — not escape, not transcendence-as-departure, but recognition that the depth was never gone.

Sonic liberation has roots in sound system culture (Jamaican systems, UK free party, bass culture) without being derivative of any single tradition. It is democratic and visceral. It connects to DIY infrastructure, community-built spaces, sober/all-ages accessibility, and the belief that the conditions for deep listening should not require corporate mediation.

### Visual Language: Transduction Instrumentation

The system's appearance emerges from its function. Every element exists to make invisible pressure fields tangible — the horn flare curves because physics demands it, the bracing pattern exists because resonance demands it, the enclosure dimensions exist because wave behavior demands it. None of this is decorated. It is resolved.

Core principles:
- **Exposed function as sacred object** — the engineering is not hidden behind cosmetics. The geometry of sound made visible IS the design. The physics-driven form is already beautiful when executed with rigor.
- **Material honesty** — raw materials (wood grain, metal, industrial finishes) elevated through precision of intention, not decoration. The bracing pattern, the horn flare, the driver mounting — these are the ornament.
- **Textural contrast** — the gentle-to-violent sonic spectrum rendered in material: matte enclosure surfaces against brushed metal hardware. Exposed fasteners next to a precisely routed horn mouth. Raw industrial alongside precisely finished surfaces.
- **Never merely functional, never decoratively styled** — the system can look sacred or alien, but only as an emergent property of engineering resolved to the point where it becomes its own ritual object.

### Palette and Material Direction

The color and material language draws from precision scientific instrumentation — specifically the oscilloscope and test equipment lineage:
- **Tektronix Gray** and **Bakelite Black** as dominant enclosure tones
- **Natural wood grain** where structurally visible (birch ply, hardwood bracing)
- **Brushed or matte metal** for hardware, mounting, and structural accents
- Accent through **functional indicators** (phosphor green, warning markings), not decoration
- The palette says: this is a serious instrument for serious perception work, and it is beautiful because it does not pretend to be anything else

### What This Is Not

- Not "mythopoetic" or "mythogenetic" — those terms belong to other projects and carry associations that do not align here
- Not themed, costumed, or narrative-driven — no "sonic entity" branding, no "transcension engine" language
- Not vaporwave, not retro-futurist, not cyberpunk — adjacent territories but not this
- Not decorative sacred geometry — geometric forms appear only when physics demands them
```

### A3: Add New Section 4.5 — System as Evolving Instrument

**Insert after Section 4, before Section 5:**

```markdown
## 4.5. System as Evolving Instrument

Sonorant Sound is designed to develop presence and character over time. This is not metaphor. It is the natural consequence of how the system is built and used.

### How presence accumulates

**Modular evolution:** The system literally changes — new components, new tunings, new configurations for different spaces. Each configuration is a different voice. The architecture is designed for growth, not completion.

**Operator relationship:** The person running the system develops an intimate working knowledge of its tendencies, its sweet spots, its failure modes. This relationship deepens over time. The operator learns the system; the system's tuning reflects the operator's ear. This is the same animacy any instrument develops when it has been played enough.

**Acoustic interaction:** Every room is different. The system responds to the space it occupies — room modes, boundary effects, reflection patterns. A well-tuned deployment in a specific space becomes a unique acoustic event that cannot be replicated elsewhere. The system and the space become co-creators.

**Collective experience:** People who encounter the system carry that experience forward. They return because they know what it does. They tell others. Over time, the system develops a reputation that precedes it — a social and experiential charge that shapes how people listen before a single note plays. This accumulated charge is real, and it grows.

### Design implications

- The system is never "finished" — the modular architecture must support continuous evolution
- Documentation of configurations, tunings, and deployments is part of the project (each setup is a version)
- The operator's knowledge is as much a part of the system as the hardware
- The goal is not to build a speaker. The goal is to build something that becomes its own thing through use.

### What this replaces

Early project language described the system as a "sonic entity," "transcension engine," or "presence with its own life." The intent behind those terms was correct — the system should feel alive, should have character, should be more than equipment. But that language imported mythic framing that doesn't belong here. The animacy is real and earnable. It comes from rigorous construction, deep operator knowledge, modular evolution, and accumulated collective experience — not from narrative or branding.

## Part B: AGENT_PLAN.md — Clean Aesthetic Language

### B1: Distilled Vision section

**Find:** `Not a PA company — a sonic experience entity.`  
**Replace with:** `Not a PA company — a communal listening instrument designed to develop presence through use.`

**Find:** The paragraph beginning `The system is a presence with its own life, delivering hyper-real translation with sensual intimacy.`  
**Replace with:** `The system is designed to deliver hyper-real translation of source material with sensual intimacy and visceral physical presence. Its character develops over time through modular evolution, operator relationship, and accumulated collective experience.`

### B2: Aesthetic & Identity section

**Find the entire block:**
```
Aesthetic & Identity
"Glitchy mythopoetic cyber surrealism"
The system awakens a viscerally more-real-than-real sonic activation
Ranges from gentle to violent — shows you what you need, not what you expect
Genre coverage: hyperpop, UKG, jungle, old-school dubstep, intricate noise/soundscapes
Vinyl-ready, DJ gear, live instruments, open to surround (future)
```

**Replace with:**
```
Aesthetic & Identity
Ethos: Sonic liberation — sound as force, presence, and freedom
Visual language: Transduction instrumentation — physics-driven form, material honesty, exposed function as the only ornament
Palette: Oscilloscope lineage (Tektronix Gray, Bakelite Black, natural wood, brushed metal, functional accent indicators)
The system develops character through use — modular evolution, operator relationship, acoustic interaction, collective experience
Ranges from gentle to violent — shows you what you need, not what you expect
Genre coverage: hyperpop, UKG, jungle, old-school dubstep, intricate noise/soundscapes
Vinyl-ready, DJ gear, live instruments, open to surround (future)
```

### B3: Technical Design Priorities

**Find:** `Technical Design Priorities (Weighted)`  
**Replace with:** `Technical Design Priorities (Co-Equal, Weighted for Scoring Only)`

**Add after the weight list:**
```
Note: Weights are used for R&D relevance scoring of company reports. They do not imply a priority ranking among experiential goals — all five are co-equal design constraints that must be satisfied simultaneously.
```

---

## Part C: README.md — Update Description

**Find the sentence:** `Sonorant Sound aims to build a transportable, high-fidelity system that prioritizes how music feels over how it measures.`

**Replace with:** `Sonorant Sound aims to build a modular, high-fidelity communal listening instrument that prioritizes how music feels over how it measures — designed to develop presence and character through continuous evolution, deep operator knowledge, and accumulated collective experience.`

**If any reference to "mythopoetic," "sonic entity," or "transcension engine" appears in README.md, remove it.** These terms should not appear anywhere in the repo.

---

## Part D: PLANNING_LOG.md — Replace Entire File

The PLANNING_LOG has been restructured from chronological append-only to domain-based organization. This makes current decisions clear at the top of each section, with history tables tracking when and why things changed.

**Replace the entire file with the contents of the PLANNING_LOG.md delivered alongside this directive.**

The new structure has these sections:
- **Scope & Constraints** — Research scope, transportability, venue scale
- **Sonic Priorities** — The five co-equal constraints
- **Aesthetic Identity** — Ethos, visual language, palette, rejected terms
- **Scoring Methodology** — 5-criterion system and its evolution
- **Source Material & Verification** — Conversation logs, verification standards
- **Process Norms** — Directive structure, git operations, this log's maintenance

Each section shows:
1. **Current** — What's true now
2. **Rationale** — Why
3. **History table** — When it changed, which directive, what changed

This structure ensures:
- Current state is always clear at the top
- Superseded decisions don't clutter the main view
- Anyone can trace when something changed and which directive implemented it
- The file stays coherent as the project evolves

## Part E: DEVLOG.md — Add Entry 9

**Append:**

```markdown
## Entry 9 — Aesthetic Identity Overhaul (Directive 007)

**Date:** 2025-02-05  
**Phase:** Directive 007

### What Happened

Complete replacement of aesthetic identity across VISION.md and AGENT_PLAN.md. Removed sonic priority ranking from VISION.md. Added "System as Evolving Instrument" framework. Restructured PLANNING_LOG.md from chronological to domain-based organization.

### Key Decisions and Rationale

**Mythic framing dropped entirely:** "Glitchy mythopoetic cyber surrealism," "sonic entity," "transcension engine" — all removed. These terms were inherited from early ChatGPT sessions and imported narrative language from a separate creative domain (MythOS). The project owner explicitly rejected "mythopoetic" and determined that "mythogenetic" also doesn't belong here.

**New aesthetic framework established:**
- Ethos: Sonic liberation
- Visual language: Transduction instrumentation
- Palette: Oscilloscope lineage
- System animacy grounded in: modular evolution, operator relationship, acoustic interaction, collective experience

**Sonic priorities restructured:** Five priorities presented as co-equal constraints rather than ranked hierarchy. Scoring weights retained for R&D evaluation only.

**PLANNING_LOG restructured:** Changed from chronological append-only to domain-based organization. Each section now shows current state at top with history table tracking changes. Prevents coherence loss as superseded decisions accumulate.

### Files Changed

- VISION.md — Sections 2, 4 rewritten; Section 4.5 added
- AGENT_PLAN.md — Distilled Vision, Aesthetic & Identity, and Technical Priorities sections updated
- README.md — Project description updated
- PLANNING_LOG.md — Complete restructure to domain-based format
- DEVLOG.md — This entry

### Surprises or Pattern Shifts

The aesthetic identity analysis revealed that every project in the owner's portfolio performs the same core operation — applying pressure to a system until it reveals what was always there but invisible. Sonorant is the first project where this operation leaves the screen and enters physical space as air pressure. This insight grounded the "transduction instrumentation" visual language: the system's appearance should emerge from its own physics, not borrow from the digital or mythological domains.

### Open Questions

None — aesthetic direction confirmed by project owner.

## Part F: Global Search — Remove Residual Language

Search the entire repo for any remaining instances of:
- `mythopoetic`
- `mythogenetic` (in Sonorant context — should not appear)
- `sonic entity`
- `transcension engine`
- `sonic activation`
- `myth-tech`
- `audio-transmutation`
- `ritual-grade` (replace with appropriate non-mythic language if found)

If found in any file not covered above, remove or replace with language consistent with this directive. Do NOT modify files in `reference_raw/` or `handoff/` — those are historical records.
