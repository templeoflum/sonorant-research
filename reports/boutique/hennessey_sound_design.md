## Company Overview

Hennessey Sound Design (now HSD Sound Systems) was founded in 2014 by Bob Trinanes and Sean Hennessey. The company originated organically: "People began calling, asking who built it, and that's how Hennessey Sound Design started – almost by accident."

The founders combine over 40 years of experience in sound design and speaker building. HSD operates with full in-house manufacturing capabilities: assembly, paint, shipping, R&D, woodworking, finishing, driver integration, and polyurea coating — all handled internally.

HSD specializes in high-output horn-loaded systems for the EDM festival circuit, targeting "bass culture loyalists" who demand extreme low-frequency performance at accessible pricing.

## Design Philosophy

**Tags:** `bass_culture`, `horn_loaded`, `festival_optimized`, `diy_ethos`, `custom_builds`

Core principles:

1. **Quality at Accessible Pricing:** High-end components (B&C, faitalPRO, BMS, 18sound, Celestion) without "outrageous prices"
2. **Horn-Loaded Efficiency:** Front-loaded horn designs for maximum output per watt
3. **Extreme Durability:** "Can it survive a week at Burning Man?" — design benchmark
4. **Full In-House Manufacturing:** Complete control from woodworking to final testing
5. **TEF25 Quality Assurance:** Rigorous measurement-based testing

## Technical Observations

### Strengths

- **Extreme LF Output:** Sherman reaches 25Hz with 24" driver in horn-loaded cabinet
- **Durability:** Burning Man survivability as design criterion
- **In-House Control:** Full manufacturing chain for quality consistency
- **Component Quality:** Premium drivers from established vendors
- **Festival-Proven:** Extensive EDM circuit validation

### Limitations

- **Scale:** Products designed for festival-scale only; Haymaker 70kg, Sherman 200kg
- **Documentation:** Limited technical specs; many details in images not text
- **No Patents:** No proprietary technology identified
- **No Independent Measurements:** All specs manufacturer claims
- **Niche Focus:** Bass culture optimization over general-purpose fidelity

### Unique Value Proposition

HSD fills a specific niche: high-quality, durable horn-loaded systems for bass music events at more accessible pricing than premium manufacturers. Full in-house manufacturing provides quality control and customization capability.

## R&D Relevance to Sonorant

| Criterion | Score (0-10) | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| HF clarity & transient | 5 | Standard compression driver HF; festival SPL optimization over fidelity |
| Directivity control & imaging | 5 | Modular waveguides (40/60/90°) but no advanced beam steering |
| Sub-weight & infrasonic | 7 | Sherman reaches 25Hz with 24" driver; horn efficiency; but 200kg |
| Psychoacoustic potential | 5 | Bass culture focus; extreme LF; but no documented research |
| Small-room viability | 2 | All products massive; festival-scale only |

**Composite Score:** 5.13/10

**Key Takeaways for Sonorant:**

1. **Not Small-Venue Focused:** Haymaker (70kg) is lightest full-range option; all subs 150kg+
2. **Horn-Loading Efficiency:** Demonstrates effective horn-loaded sub design for output/efficiency
3. **Durability Engineering:** Burning Man survivability benchmark worth noting for outdoor applications
4. **Component Sourcing:** Validates Celestion TSQ, B&C, faitalPRO as quality driver sources
5. **Bass Culture Context:** Understanding extreme LF requirements for electronic music applications
