## Company Overview

Danley Sound Labs was founded in 2005 by Tom Danley (Director of R&D) and Mike Hedden (entrepreneur, formerly owner of dB Audio & Video). The company is renowned for pioneering the Synergy Horn and Tapped Horn technologies, creating point-source loudspeakers that achieve coherent full-range reproduction from a single horn aperture.

## Design Philosophy

**Tags:** `point_source_coherent`, `multi_entry_horn`, `tapped_horn`, `constant_directivity`, `low_distortion`, `time_alignment`

Danley's philosophy centers on acoustic correctness at the source rather than corrective DSP. Tom Danley emphasizes elegant simplicity: *"The best solutions come when you find the simplest answer whose form is driven by the problem and conditions."*

The Synergy Horn technology combines multiple drivers of varying bandwidths into a single horn, making them behave as a single full-range point source. This eliminates the lobing, comb filtering, and phase anomalies inherent in traditional multi-box systems.

### Notable Quotes

> "The Synergy Horn appears and measures as one crossover-less driver with minimal lobing or null zones."
> — Tom Danley, audioXpress Q&A [1]

> "Tom Danley, a literal rocket scientist, applied his expertise in acoustics and wave propagation from NASA research to revolutionize the audio industry."
> — Danley Sound Labs [2]

## Core Technologies

### 1. Synergy Horn (US6411718B1)
- **Patent:** US6411718B1, filed 1999, granted 2002
- **Inventors:** Thomas J. Danley, Bradford J. Skuran
- **Principle:** Multiple drivers mounted along outer wall of a single horn, each positioned where the horn's expansion rate matches its frequency band. All drivers sum at a single aperture, creating true point-source behavior.
- **Benefits:** Eliminates throat distortion, reduces comb filtering, enables extreme pattern control, coherent phase response across bandwidth.

### 2. Tapped Horn (US8457341B2)
- **Patent:** US8457341B2, filed 2007, granted 2013
- **Inventor:** Thomas J. Danley
- **Principle:** Driver's front and rear radiation both load through a horn structure via a "tap point." At low frequencies, one side dominates; as frequency rises, both combine constructively.
- **Benefits:** Achieves output of dual-18" conventional subs from a single driver. 5-fold increase in sensitivity demonstrated in testing.

### 3. Paraline
- **Patent:** Filed 2011
- **Principle:** Combines output of multiple HF drivers into a common chamber, creating planar or curved wavefronts. Simulates very large horns (>25ft effective path length) in compact form.
- **Application:** SBH "Skinny Big Horn" column speakers — horn performance in column aesthetics without DSP.

### 4. Shaded Amplitude Lens
- **Patent:** 2009
- **Principle:** Uses vanes to deflect portions of HF driver output, creating different path lengths and amplitude shading. Achieves consistent SPL across large seating areas (±1dB variation).
- **Application:** Stadium installations (Turner Field), Jericho line.

### 5. Cohearix Lens (2024 Provisional)
- **Status:** Provisional patent filed 2024
- **Principle:** Allows HF drivers to be placed edge-to-edge, with each "bowtie" producing one segment of a larger radiation arc. Sum into single source without seam.
- **Application:** New loudspeaker family scheduled for 2025 release.

## R&D Relevance to Sonorant

| Criterion | Score (0-10) | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| HF clarity & transient | 9 | Synergy Horn design eliminates comb filtering; independent measurements confirm excellent transient response |
| Directivity control & imaging | 10 | Core competency — true point source with ±30° tight pattern control, coherent phase |
| Sub-weight & infrasonic | 8 | Tapped Horn achieves 28Hz (−10dB) from single 18"; BC218 reaches 22Hz |
| Psychoacoustic potential | 8 | Phase coherence across bandwidth; "depth of soundstage" noted in measurements |
| Small-room viability | 7 | SM60F at 22.7 kg (50 lbs) suitable for 100-200 cap; Love Inn case study validates small venue deployment |

**Composite Score:** 8.58/10

**Key Takeaways for Sonorant:**
1. Synergy Horn is the foundational MEH technology — study US6411718B1 closely
2. Tapped Horn patents (US8457341B2) highly relevant for sub architecture
3. SM60F is appropriately sized for 100-200 cap venues (50lbs, 60°×60°)
4. TH118 sub delivers 28Hz extension in 160lb package
5. Love Inn case study directly validates Danley for intimate club contexts
