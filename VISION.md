# Sonorant Sound — Vision Document

**Version:** 1.0
**Extracted from:** conversation logs (reference_raw/)
**Last Updated:** 2025-02-05

This document captures the experiential goals and design parameters for Sonorant Sound, extracted from conversation logs. These are statements of *intent*, not technical specifications. No claims from the logs have been verified.

## 1. Experiential Intent

The system is designed to deliver a listening experience that feels transcendent and transformative. In the user's words:

> "utterly transcendent, like you are transported to a completely different realm of existence"

> "a presence, a life of its own delivering a mix of a sort of hyper real translation of the material, and a sensual almost seductive intimacy"

> "either ripped violently out of this dimension into a new one or transported ever so gracefully and lovingly into aural love making"

> "shows you what you need and didn't know you want rather than what you expect pushing you out of your comfort zone into rapid growth"

The system should feel like a presence rather than disappear into transparency. It is intended for communal and performative contexts — intimate gatherings where the sound itself becomes the focal experience. The goal is not reference-style flat playback but psychoacoustic enhancement that heightens the emotional and physical impact of music.

## 2. Sonic Priorities (Ranked)

Based on emphasis patterns in conversation logs:

1. **Psychoacoustic immersion** — spatial depth, envelopment, the "audio moment"; wide stereo imaging that creates a believable soundstage

2. **Sub weight** — tactile, chest-presence bass with infrasonic extension; sub-30Hz response that you feel, not just hear; "chest pressure, not just rumble"

3. **Hyper-real clarity** — crystal clear vocals, high resolution for intricate soundscapes; preservation of microdetails even in lo-fi or bitcrushed recordings

4. **Fast transients** — snap, articulation, dynamic punch; tight transient control especially in sub and mid-bass range

5. **Small-room optimization** — 100–200 capacity venues; reflection control; must translate emotionally in nearfield or small space

`[NEEDS CONFIRMATION]` This ranking is derived from emphasis patterns in conversation logs, not from a formal prioritization exercise. The user should confirm or adjust these priorities.

## 3. Operational Parameters

**Venue scale:**
- 100–200 person capacity
- Small rooms, outdoors, portable contexts
- Transportability is valued but does not restrict research scope — the end product should move and set up easily, but research should not prematurely eliminate topologies based on weight or form factor

**Form factor:**
- Open to stackable or low-profile configurations
- Modular evolution path (start with 2.1, expand over time)

**Signal chain:**
- Tunable (DSP, EQ curves, phase alignment)
- Inputs: vinyl, DJ gear, live instruments
- Surround: late-stage goal, not immediate priority

**Use case:**
- Purely a listening system, not production monitoring
- Clarity over loudness
- "Ritual-grade, intimate performance system"

## 4. Aesthetic Identity

**Visual direction:**
> "glitchy mythopoetic cyber surrealism"

**Symbolic identity:**
- No name or sigil decided yet `[NEEDS CONFIRMATION]`
- System conceived as an awakening tool
- "viscerally more-real-than-real sonic activation"
- Range from gentle to violent

**Design language:**
- Can look sacred or alien, but never merely "functional"
- Aesthetic and sonic tuning both matter

## 5. Musical Context

**Reference playlist:** `https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0ss89af8ddF56e0xblrXIQ`

**Genre coverage (from playlist analysis):**
- Psychoacoustic/ambient: Burial, Aphex Twin, Telefon Tel Aviv, Oneohtrix Point Never
- Bass/glitch: G Jones, Eprom, Machinedrum, Ivy Lab, Shades
- Hyperpop: underscores, glaive, ericdoa, 100 gecs
- Chopped & screwed: DJ Screw, DJ Rashad
- Punk/metal: Rancid, Dead Kennedys, Metallica, Tool
- Future soul/R&B: Ta-ku, Lapalux, Sango, Hundred Waters

**Playback philosophy:**
- Prioritize psychoacoustic enhancement over reference-style flat playback
- System should render microdetails even in lo-fi/bitcrushed recordings
- Wide dynamic range — from violent distortion to ambient breath

## 6. Key Design Implications

From the musical context and experiential goals, the system must handle:

| Requirement | Implication |
|------------|-------------|
| Fine stereo imaging | Matched speaker symmetry, controlled dispersion |
| Gentle reverb tails preserved | No harshness in highs |
| Ultra-low content (20–35Hz) | Drivers must respond cleanly; sub felt before heard |
| Fast driver response | Especially in upper mids for hyperpop/glitch |
| Smooth rolloff into subharmonics | Not abrupt or thin |
| Midrange clarity and bite | For guitars/vocals in dense mixes |
| Seductive top end | Silky, not brittle; reverbs must bloom |

## Open Questions

- [ ] Confirm sonic priority ranking (Section 2)
- [ ] Symbolic identity / naming decision
- [ ] Surround timeline — when does this become a priority?
- [ ] Budget constraints for initial build vs. upgrade path
